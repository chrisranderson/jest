# Generation

# Editing

## Plausible
- wildly exaggerate
- hard consonants, alliteration, assonance
- rule of three - use a list, ending with the trigger

## Less plausible
- Shorten.
- end on the funniest word
- don't hint at the punchline early
- make the punchline sound like other parts of the joke
- get specific. Not "deli meat", but "cold cut platter from blimpie"

## Impossible
- topic goes from least important to most important
- don't be too obvious/plain: allude to things, help people figure it out on their own
